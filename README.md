# Equingo

Equingo is a simple JavaScript library to transform formulas into MongoDB aggregation queries.

## Getting Started

To run equingo, you need to include the file `src/equingo.js` in your HTML.

```HTML
<script src="path-to-equingo.js"></script>
```

## Deployment

As for now, the code can be included as the file itself in you project. Hopefully someday it will be in npm and some CDN.
